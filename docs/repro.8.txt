repro(8)
========

Name
----
repro - reproducible builds utility


Synopsis
--------
'repro' <command> [options]


Description
-----------
'repro' is a script to help with verifying and checking reproducibility of
packages. It builds a linkman:systemd-nspawn[1] container with the Arch Linux
bootstrap image to build packages in a clean chroot. It has two modes of
operation, 'build' and 'check'.

'build' assumed a linkman:PKGBUILD[5] in the current directory and attempts to
build this twice and compares the resulting checksums. 'build' also takes
profiles (see linkman:repo.profile[5]) to change the build environment when
doing subsequent builds. These will be compared to the first build to check for
reproducibility

'check' takes a package as an argument and attempts to recreate the package with
the information provided with linkman:BUILDINFO[5]. It will use the Arch Linux
archive to fetch packages with the correct pkgver.


Commands
--------
**build**::
        Builds a package twice and compares sha512 checksums to check for
        reproducability issues. This assumes the current directory contains a
        PKGBUILD. See linkman:PKGBUILD[5] (This is the default command)   

**check** <package>::
        TBA
    

Options
-------
*-b* [number] ::
        Sets how many subsequent builds should be run with random profiles (see
        linkman:repro.profile[5]). Defaults to 1.

*-d*::
        When enabled linkman:diffoscope[1] is run on the produced packages.
        `DIFFOSCOPE` can be set in linkman:repro.conf[5] to change the
        diffoscope command.

*-p* <profile>::
        Absolute path for a profile to be used when doing subsequent builds. See
        linkman:repro.profile[5].

*-o*::
        Mounts the container inside linkman:disorderfs[1] to create an
        unpredictable filesystem listing.

*-C* <file>::
        Specify a linkman:repro.conf[5] file to use for the build container.

*-P* <file>::
        Specify a linkman:pacman.conf[5] file to use for the build container.

*-M* <file>::
        Specify a linkman:makepkg.conf[5] file to use for the build container.


Configuration
-------------
See linkman:repro.conf[5] for more details on configuring repro using the
'repro.conf' file.


Profiles
--------
See linkman:repro.profile[5] for more details on how to change the environemnt
of builds.
